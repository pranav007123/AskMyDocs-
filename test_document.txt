Flask RAG Application Test Document

This is a test document for the Flask RAG application. The application uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions based on uploaded documents.

Key Features:
- User authentication with Flask-Login
- Document upload supporting PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
- Text extraction and chunking
- Vector embeddings using Sentence Transformers
- FAISS for similarity search
- AI-powered responses using Gemini API

The system processes documents by:
1. Extracting text from uploaded files
2. Splitting text into chunks of approximately 500 tokens
3. Generating embeddings for each chunk
4. Storing embeddings in a FAISS index
5. Retrieving relevant chunks for user queries
6. Using Gemini to generate contextual responses

This test document contains information about machine learning, natural language processing, and document retrieval systems.
